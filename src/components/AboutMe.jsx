        <p className="text-p w-3/4 mb-32">I'm Hemal! I'm an aspiring full stack engineer currently studying at McMaster University. 
        I'm forever desiring to expand my horizons with different languages and frameworks while enhancing my current skills. Fun fact, 
        I have a minor in biochemistry, so I have a keen interest in bioinformatics. Outside of work and school, I play the guitar (which I taught myself!) 
        and love video games (Stardew Valley and RPGs so count!). Thanks for visiting the site! </p>
